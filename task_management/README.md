## Task Management
Implement crud operation to create, add, update and delete tasks.
I am using XAMP server to run my code. Database is mysql.
I have used Bootstrap4 for frontend design. 

### Implementations
1. login, 
2. User can create, edit and delete tasks. View own tasks.

## What I learned?
- PHP syntax,
- mysql query for CRUD operation
- $_SESSION to store user information for login.
- configure to connect mysqlDb.
- secure the page by passing $_SESSION['id'].
- only authrised user can edit and delete their tasks.
- file upload, edit and delete
